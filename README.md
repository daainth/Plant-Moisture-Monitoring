# Plant-Moisture-Monitoring
A personal project which I use to further develop my skills with a Computer Engineering background. The main goal of this project is to create a remote plant monitoring system that will help me maintain the lives of my plants. 
Goals
- Develop a wireless system to connect via some low power method
- Utilize a database to store telemetry and historical data
- Some UI via a website that will instantly tell me the moisture status for the plants

Long Terms Goals(Maybes)
- Data visualization on the website
- Machine learning integration
- A mobile application
